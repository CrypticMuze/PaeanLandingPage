                    Paean is an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app for children with speech difficulties. Paean gives a voice for these children, to help them express their needs, wants, thoughts and feelings through the app. It is useful for children who are non- verbal or have delayed or unclear speech, or single-word communicators, developmental delays etc.

                    When you are on the move at or away from home, you can’t have software developed for those with computer science degrees. Setting it up ought to be easy, since the life of a special needs family is already complicated. You also don’t need software capable of giving a college lecture. Quick Talk is an AAC communication app that allows for quick and functional conversation, when you are on the move.

                    Provides natural sounding Text to Speech voices, a high resolution library of over 14,000 symbols, powerful automatic conjugations, two researched-based vocabulary organizations, advanced word prediction, multiuser support, and the ability to fully customize vocabularies for users along a broad continuum of abilities, from beginning symbolic communication to full literacy.

                    A great communication device needs to travel with you and fit in a pant pocket or purse. With Quick Talk, our AAC communication app, you can go anywhere with your child, whip out your phone or tablet, and communicate at the speed of life.

                    You want the software to work for you, not have you working for it. You don’t want a bunch of stuff someone else set up, and make your family adapt to their style of communication. You want something you can customize. Quick Talk allows for personalized rather than engineered communication.
